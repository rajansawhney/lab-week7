/*
Write a C Program that finds and prints all prime numbers in an interval between two integers.
Interval numbers are not inclusive.

NOTE:
1. Must use at least 2 functions ( one being main() )
2. Accept only positive integers
3. Handle scenario where first number (n1) is larger than second number (n2)
4. Display output in the following format only:
    Prime numbers between <num1> and <num2> are:
    <print all the prime numbers separated by ONE SPACE in one line (not including interval numbers)>

Eg:
Prime numbers between 12 and 55 are:
13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53
